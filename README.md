## our mission

we aim to create an accessible community and social service culture for the younger, rising generations through a framework of digital "ripl"s intented to promote community and corporate-sponsored service or engangement events spread through modern day's greatest wildfire: social media.

we will start by working to integrate the snapchat api into our app, and we can expand from there.

## how to run

in the repository:

  `npm start`

or
  
  `expo start`
  
## additional notes

our project is a work in progress! it is far from complete, so we will develop it further in the future.
