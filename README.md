## our mission

we aim to create an accessible community and social service culture for the younger, rising generations through a framework of digital "ripl"s promoting community or corporate-sponsored service or engangement events spread through our modern day's greatest wildfire: social media.

we will start by working to integrate the snapchat api into our app.

## how to run

in the repository:

  npm start

or
  
  expo start
  
## additional notes

our project is a work in progress! it is far from complete, so we will develop it further in the future.
